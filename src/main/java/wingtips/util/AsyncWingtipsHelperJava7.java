/**
 * Helper class that provides static methods for dealing with async stuff in Wingtips, mainly providing easy ways
 * to support distributed tracing and logger MDC when hopping threads using {@link Executor}s, etc. There are various
 * {@code *WithTracing(...)} methods for wrapping objects with the same type that knows how to handle tracing and
 * MDC. You can also call the various {@code linkTracingToCurrentThread(...)} and {@code
 * unlinkTracingFromCurrentThread(...)} methods directly if you want to do it manually yourself.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: This is the Java 7 version of {@code AsyncWingtipsHelper} from the wingtips-java8 module. The Java 8 version
 * contains more options and flexibility and should be used instead of this class in a Java 8 environment. This class
 * really only helps for {@link Runnable}s and {@link Callable}s - the Java 8 version supports many more functional
 * interfaces and lambda types.
 *
 * <p>Here's an example of making the current thread's tracing and MDC info hop to a thread executed by an
 * {@link Executor}:
 * <pre>
 *   import static samplewingtips.util.AsyncWingtipsHelperStatic.runnableWithTracing;
 *
 *   // ...
 *
 *   executor.execute(runnableWithTracing(new Runnable() {
 *       &amp;Override
 *       public void run() {
 *           // Code that needs tracing/MDC wrapping goes here
 *       }
 *   }));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Functionally equivalent to the {@link Executor} example above, but with a {@link ExecutorServiceWithTracing} to
 * automate the thread-hopping behavior whenever the {@link Executor} (or {@link ExecutorService}) executes something
 * (be careful about this if you spin off work that *shouldn't* automatically inherit the calling thread's tracing
 * state - see the warning on {@link #executorServiceWithTracing(ExecutorService)}):
 * <pre>
 *   import static samplewingtips.util.AsyncWingtipsHelperStatic.executorServiceWithTracing;
 *
 *   // ...
 *
 *   Executor executor = executorServiceWithTracing(Executors.newCachedThreadPool());
 *
 *   executor.execute(new Runnable() {
 *       &amp;Override
 *       public void run() {
 *           // Code that needs tracing/MDC wrapping goes here
 *       }
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This example shows how you might accomplish tasks in an environment where the tracing information is attached
 * to some request context, and you need to temporarily attach the tracing info in order to do something (e.g. log some
 * messages with tracing info automatically added using MDC):
 * <pre>
 *     import static samplewingtips.util.AsyncWingtipsHelperStatic.runnableWithTracing;
 *
 *     // ...
 *
 *     TracingState tracingInfo = requestContext.getTracingInfo();
 *     runnableWithTracing(
 *         new Runnable() {
 *             &amp;Override
 *             public void run() {
 *                 // Code that needs tracing/MDC wrapping goes here
 *             }
 *         },
 *         tracingInfo
 *     ).run();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>If you want to use the link and unlink methods manually to wrap some chunk of code, the general procedure looks
 * like this:
 * <pre>
 *  import static samplewingtips.util.AsyncWingtipsHelperStatic.linkTracingToCurrentThread;
 *  import static samplewingtips.util.AsyncWingtipsHelperStatic.unlinkTracingFromCurrentThread;
 *
 *  // ...
 *
 *  TracingState originalThreadInfo = null;
 *  try {
 *      originalThreadInfo = linkTracingToCurrentThread(...);
 *      // Code that needs tracing/MDC wrapping goes here
 *  }
 *  finally {
 *      unlinkTracingFromCurrentThread(originalThreadInfo);
 *  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Following this procedure (either the all-in-one {@code *WithTracing(...)} methods or the manual procedure)
 * guarantees that the code you want wrapped will be wrapped successfully with whatever tracing and MDC info you want,
 * and when it finishes the trace and MDC info will be put back the way it was as if your code never ran.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: If your class only needs one tracing-wrapped type then you can pull in the slightly less verbose static
 * helper methods directly from the class, e.g. {@code RunnableWithTracing.withTracing(...)}, and then your
 * code could be the more compact {@code withTracing(...)} rather than {@code runnableWithTracing(...)}. If you need
 * multiple tracing-wrapped types in the same class then the slightly longer-named methods in this helper class can
 * be used to disambiguate.
 *
 * <p>WARNING: Be careful with the manual {@code linkTracingToCurrentThread(...)} method to link tracing and MDC.
 * If you fail to guarantee the associated unlink at the end then you risk having traces stomp on each other or having
 * other weird interactions occur that you wouldn't expect or predict. This can mess up your tracing, so before you use
 * the manual linking/unlinking procedure make sure you know what you're doing and test thoroughly in a multi-threaded
 * way under load, and with failure scenarios. For this reason it's recommended that you use the
 * {@code *WithTracing(...)} methods whenever possible instead of manual linking/unlinking.
 *
 * @deprecated This class should be considered deprecated - eventually Java 7 support will be dropped. Please use
 * the Java 8 version of this class ({@code AsyncWingtipsHelper} or the static {@code AsyncWingtipsHelperStatic})
 * whenever possible.
