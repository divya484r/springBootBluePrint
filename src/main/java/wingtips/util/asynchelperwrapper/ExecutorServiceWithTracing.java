/**
 * A wrapper around any {@link ExecutorService} instance that causes the current (method caller's) tracing state to hop
 * threads when {@link Runnable}s or {@link Callable}s are supplied for execution. Simply supply the constructor with
 * the delegate {@link ExecutorService} you want to wrap (often one from {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors}) and
 * then treat it like any other {@link ExecutorService}. Shutdown and termination methods pass through to the
 * delegate - {@link ExecutorServiceWithTracing} does not contain any state of its own.
 *
 * <p>WARNING: Keep in mind that you should avoid using a {@link ExecutorServiceWithTracing} when spinning off
 * background threads that aren't tied to a specific trace, or in any other situation where an executed
 * {@link Runnable}/{@link Callable} should *not* automatically inherit the calling thread's tracing state!
 *
 * <p>Usage example (written with Java 8 lambda syntax for the {@link Runnable} for brevity):
 * <pre>
 * // In some setup location, create the ExecutorServiceWithTracing.
 * ExecutorService tracingAwareExecutorService = new ExecutorServiceWithTracing(Executors.newCachedThreadPool());
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * // Elsewhere, setup the tracing state for the caller's thread.
 * Tracer.getInstance().startRequestWithRootSpan("someRootSpan");
 * TracingState callerThreadTracingState = TracingState.getCurrentThreadTracingState();
 *
 * // Tell the tracing-wrapped executor to execute a Runnable.
 * tracingAwareExecutorService.execute(() -> {
 *     // Runnable's execution code goes here.
 *     // The important bit is that although we are no longer on the caller's thread, this Runnable's thread
 *     //     will have the same tracing state as the caller. The following line will not throw an exception.
 *     assert callerThreadTracingState.equals(TracingState.getCurrentThreadTracingState());
 * });
 * </pre>
