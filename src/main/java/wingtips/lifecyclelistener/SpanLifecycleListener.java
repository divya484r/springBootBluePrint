/**
 * Listener interface for {@link Tracer} that allows you to be notified during various span lifecycle events (span created/started, span sampled, span completed).
 * Call {@link Tracer#addSpanLifecycleListener(SpanLifecycleListener)} to add a specific listener.
 * <p/>
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: Tracing can become a severe bottleneck for high throughput services if the implementation of any of these methods are expensive. If any of the work you
 *                 need to do in these methods takes more than a few nanoseconds and you have a high throughput service you may want to consider doing the work asynchronously.
 *                 If you do anything here make sure you profile your application with and without the {@link SpanLifecycleListener} enabled to see how it impacts performance.
